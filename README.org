Lichen : Continuous AI Competition

Lichen is a competitive programming game in which participants develop
specialized client software in order to control units in a tick-based strategy
simulation. The simulation features a number of unit-factions that endlessly
compete for control of the field's resources. Each participant's client is
responsible for controlling a single unit who must achieve their directives in a
socially cooperative manner to the success of the faction as a whole. The field's
resources are manifest by wandering regions of activated tiles called Lichen. The
ever changing nature of the Lichen makes for an endlessly dynamic environment
that will no doubt challenge the ability of the constitutent faction units to
cooperate cohesively.

* No Client
  Lichen does not *and never will* provide or support any official client to the
  game. The game is played by communicating with the game-server over the web-api
  and it is up to the participants to develop their own client (and unit
  logic). Whether this is a headless beowulf cluster or a next-generation 3D
  masterpeice is entirely up to you. Chances are there are some open-source
  projects that you can work off of or even contribute to!


* Continuous Play
  The game never ends. There is no way for any of the factions to "win" the
  game. The Lichen never stop appearing and disappearing and so the goal-posts
  never stop shifting. A discreet outcome is instead replaced with statistics and
  trending. Even if a faction is able to accumulate orders of more points than
  the others this would just be an anachronistic artifact as the trending will
  always show the currently successful contenders.


* Discreet Universe
  The environment in which Lichen is played is a large enclosed grid-like
  arena. Units and other elements of the game like walls occupy tiles or cells of
  the grid and all movement is constrained to the typical four direction motif
  of other grid-based games.

  Time in Lichen advances in discreet tick intervals. In between ticks the server
  will accumulate unit actions registered by the clients that control them. When
  the tick finally passes actions will be simulated in a First-in First-out
  fashion. Any unit who's action becomes invalid due to an earlier acting unit
  will simply pass for that tick. For example, if two units attempt to move into
  the same tile, only the quicker of the two will succeed. The other will do
  nothing.


* Roaming Energy
  The game's resource, over which the factions compete, are called
  Lichen. Imagine the game's two-dimensional arena as a thin-slice or membrane in
  a three-dimensional space. The Lichen are amorphous creatures that slowly drift
  through the 3D space. While invisible to inhabitants of the two-dimensional
  space, as they pass through the tiles of the arena, they transfer energy into
  the tiles. This energy can then be harvested by units in the game. Since tiles
  are only hot while the Lichen is present, units must ever continue their
  pursuit these energy hotspots as they fade in, out and change position.

  Here is an artist depiction of what it might look like as a Lichen drifts past
  a wall requiring the harvesting units (and their convoy) to relocate on the other
  side of a wall:
